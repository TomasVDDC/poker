*features*:
- on the player show page we need to see the number of games they played, and their past stats 
  - for now added the same chart as the main page 
- should really have a *navigation bar*, can be a sidebar or a topbar. Essentially what all the other websites have something that stays regardless of which page you are currently on.

*fix*
- when you are already logged in and you try to sign in it doesnt redirect you to the clubs page
